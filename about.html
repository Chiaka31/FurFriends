    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The founders of Fur Friends have been friends since they attended college in Burlington, Vermont, and adopted Sadie, the inspiration for Fur Friends.</p>

    <h3>Sadie's Story - 1999 - 2007</h3>
    <img class="about-image" src="/Images/IMAGE-Sadie.png" alt="Sadie Cat" style="width:30%">
    <p>Our beloved Sadie, the inspiration for Fur Friends, adopted us - four college students - as her forever family in 1999 when she took refuge under the porch of our apartment house in Burlington, Vermont. All of us remember that day like it was yesterday.</p>
    <p>It was cold and rainy, and the weather forecast had called for light flurries, which wasn't out of the norm since it was early November. We had planned to skip the Ramen and walk to Church Street to have pizza for dinner. While we were on the porch, waiting for Aurora to retrieve a jacket, one of us heard a faint meow. When we heard it again, we investigated and found the calico who would eventually be known as Sadie.</p>
    <p>Sadie was suffering. The veterinarian who treated her - we skipped the pizza - said she had been hit by a car and the accident had crushed her tail and leg. Both were amputated because of infection and for weeks we weren't sure if she would live, much less recover.</p>
    <p>Well, Sadie did recover and she went to live with Clarisa in Jericho, Vermont, after we graduated. She remained a loyal and loving calico until she crossed the Rainbow Bridge in 2007.</p>
